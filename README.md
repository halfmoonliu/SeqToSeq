# SeqToSeq
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for machine translation, one using sequence-to-sequence model and the other used attention-based model. The dataset used is downloaded from Tatoeba (https://tatoeba.org/), containing more than 100,000 French-English sentence pairs. In the current results, the attention-based model gained 7.6% in BLEU score than the seq-to-seq model.
